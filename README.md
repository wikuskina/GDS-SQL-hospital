# Database for hospital using SQL 
Study case, my own work.

UK healthcare provider required assistance in re-organisation of its databases. There was an objective to create one centralised database that was easily accessible and searchable.
The organisation consists of several clinics and doctors working there. Each doctor can work at multiple clinics and treat multiple patients; however, each doctor can only have a single area they specialise in. Patients treated at clinics can be affected by several diseases, from which they will either recover or die.  

Database was designed using SQL and DBeaver 21.3.2 software. It was filled with sample entries of 10 diseases, 10 clinics, 10 patients, and 10 doctors, which are not real patients, doctors, diseases, or clinics. This was done to showcase how data can be stored and organised. 

Several SQL queries were created, as requested, to establish:
a) All patients that died at specific clinic from disease.
b) Number of diseases (patients) treated by each doctor.
c) Diseases that occur most often.
d) Number of patients who died in a given clinic & while treated by doctor in a year.

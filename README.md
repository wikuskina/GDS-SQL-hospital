# Database for hospital using SQL 
Study case, my own work.

UK healthcare provider required assistance in re-organisation of its databases. Subsequently, there was an objective to create one centralised database that was easily accessible and searchable.
The organisation consists of several clinics and doctors working there. Each doctor can work at multiple clinics and treat multiple patients; however, each doctor can only have a single area they specialise in. Patients treated at clinics can be affected by several diseases, from which they will either recover or die. 

Database was filled with sample entries of 10 diseases, 10 clinics, 10 patients, and 10 doctors, which are not real patients, doctors, diseases, or clinics. This was done to showcase how data can be stored and organised in the future by the organisation.
